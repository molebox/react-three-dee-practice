Practicing 3D stuff with react

Watched a video from [Wrong Akram](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrxiLP9RHz2GxDJaZuTRBw) that was very clear and well explained. There were some concepts and stuff that I wanted to know more about though. So this repo is basically just a mess of copy paste code, trying stuff out, links to good sources. 

- The scenes and camera are built into the Canvas. We cant write HTML directly in the Canvas but we can use a helper component from drei called Html which will allow us to include HTML code. 
- The cameras position is [x, y, z] where z is the depth. fov stands for field of view
- ambientLight gives a soft light
- directionalLight is the main source of light that casts the shadows
- pointLight is a light from the side
